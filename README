This script can be used to rename files in a directory with a given base name and a sequence number.

Note that the script takes the top Finder window as the directory with the files to rename. Also note that all files in this directory will be renamed.

For example:
Say we have DSC0001.jpg, DSC0002.jpg, … , DSC0255.jpg in a directory and we want these to be renamed to Vacation 001.jpg, Vacation 002.jpg, … , Vacation 255.jpg. First, we open the directory with Finder, and then we run the script. Given the new name "Vacation", the script renames the files as desired.
